In this directory are three routines for load balancing:
loadBalance.F90  loadBalanceFluxTubeBiasMethod.F90  loadBalanceFluxTube.F90

loadBalanceFluxTubeBiasMethod.F90 and loadBalanceFluxTube.F90 are two load balancing methods based of balancing the flux tubes.
loadBalance.F90 is based on balancing the times from a representative run.

For the current (3/24/17) cases loadBalance.F90 works best.

For more information see the comments in loadBalance.F90.
