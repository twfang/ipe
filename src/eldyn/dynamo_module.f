! !MODULE: dynamo_module
! !DESCRIPTION: 
!
! Module for electrodynamic dynamo (the "e" in tiegcm). 
!
! 5/02 btf: This is the "new" dynamo code, adapted by Astrid Maute
! and Art Richmond from the original ("old") dynamo in tgcm15,
! written by E. Cicely Ridley completed in about 1992. 
!
! Sub prep_dynamo is called from advance. Prep_dynamo prepares dynamo 
! input fields and gathers them to the root task (mp_dynamo_gather).
! Next, advance calls sub dynamo (the dynamo driver), which controls
! the dynamo subroutine calls. Prep_dynamo and the dynamo driver are
! called once per timestep, after sub dynamics.
!
! Since the dynamo is serial (as of 4/02), the master task must receive
! subdomain data from other tasks for input fields to the dynamo 
! (on the geographic grid). These fields are exchanged via sub 
! mp_dynamo_gather which is called from prep_dynamo below.
!

!           for George Millward
! 05.02.04  Astrid Maute: include headers
! 
! comments from the original coupled code with CTIP
! am 10/04: adapte the electrodynamo from tiegcm1.6 for the
! coupling with a plasmasphere model
! -electro-dynamo is serial
! -high latitude potential is still in the code but shouldn't be 
! specified (set crit(1) and crit(2) to zero or small value
! crit(1), crit(2) colatitude for boundary of specified high lat. 
! potential (lat_m < crit(1) ) and transitions zone (crit(1)< lat_m < crit(2)
! - output eletric potential in magnetic coordinates
!          electric field in magnetic coordinates
!
! Module for electrodynamic dynamo (the "e" in tiegcm). 
!
! 5/02 btf: This is the "new" dynamo code, adapted by Astrid Maute
! and Art Richmond from the original ("old") dynamo in tgcm15,
