C:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: CTIPINT :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
C.... Interface for CTIP model. This routine uploads the CTIPe variables to 
C.... modules and calls the different FLIP routines.
C.... The parameters ending in X are dummy variables to be transferred to 
C.... the FLIP module variables. 
C.... Dummy variables are also used because it is assumed that the values 
C.... of FLIP variables are not preserved from call to call
C---- Additional mods Change TI to (TI(2,DIM)
C---- Change SCOLUMN for grazing incidence
C.... Written by P. Richards June-September 2010.
